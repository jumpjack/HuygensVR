# Panoramas/mosaics:

There are [12 mosaics available](https://archives.esac.esa.int/psa/ftp/CASSINI-HUYGENS/DISR/HP-SSA-DISR-2-3-EDR-RDR-V1.3/EXTRAS/MOSAICS/MOSIACS_PNG/); the file names matche with ground resolution, e.g. 4.PNG has a 4m/pixel resolution:

- 1.PNG
- 2.PNG
- 3.PNG
- 4.PNG
- 5.PNG
- 10.PNG
- 15.PNG
- 20.PNG
- 30.PNG
- 40.PNG
- 50.PNG
- 60.PNG

The projection used for these mosaics is currently unknown.

There are also some "posters" available in this folder; poster "C" contains 6 stereographic fisheye images taken from different altitudes: 150 km, 20km, 6km, 2km, 0.6km, 0.2km; FOV unknown (full size image [here](https://archives.esac.esa.int/psa/ftp/CASSINI-HUYGENS/DISR/HP-SSA-DISR-2-3-EDR-RDR-V1.3/EXTRAS/POSTERS/POSTER_C.JPG)):

Descriptions:

Poster A - View's from the probe, in the 4 Cardinal
Directions (N,S,E,W) at 5 different altitudes above Titan's
surface.

Poster B - Mercator Projection of the view from the Huygens
probe at 4 different altitudes.

Poster C - Nadir, Stereographic (fish-eye) view of Titan's
surface from 6 different altitudes.  Shows the haze layer at
20-21 Km.

Poster D - Mercator projection of Huygens probe view from 10
Km Altitude.

Poster E - Distorted fish-eye projection (in nadir
direction) of the DISR images when the Huygens Probe was 5
Km above Titan's surface.

Poster F - Composite view of DISR's images taken while the
Huygens Probe was setting on Titan's surface, juxtaposed
with a similarly scaled picture taken on the Moon's surface.
Objects near the center of the picture are roughly the size
of a man's foot while objects at the horizon are a fraction
of a man's height.

Poster G - When printed on letter sized paper this poster
show's the size of the 'rocks' on Titan's surface in their
true size.

# Huygens cameras

Panoramas were created from images taken from 3 cameras: HRI, LRI, SLI; their FOVs are represented in picture below:

There is also a visual imager pointed to the sky, the Solar Aureole imager (SA):
